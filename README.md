# PSYSearchController

PSYSearchController is a simple SearchController in Objective-C, with custome filter (date, category, and area)

# Demo

# Installation
PSYSearchController is using cocoapods for library management, so please advise to install cocoapod first by sudo gem install cocoapods. 

Once it done,
Navigate to the project directory, run pod install

For now the only way to use PSYSearchController is download/clone the project and copy the directory PSYSearchController into your project. (will add the project cocoapods as soon as possible)
